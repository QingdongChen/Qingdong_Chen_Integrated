## Installation
I wrote the dining and Rooms pages, and for the problem of using the ::after pseudo-selector to add a graphical element indicating completion, I did this task in the expanded list of the dining page, you can click on one of the lists, and the list will expand, And a star icon will appear to the right of the text you click. For button animation, I added animation to the "send" submit button at the bottom of my Rooms page. A shadow appears when you mouse over a button, and when you click the button and the font of the button get larger and the shadow disappears.
## Usage
You can expand the bar by clicking the menu and switch between the home, dining and rooms pages by clicking
